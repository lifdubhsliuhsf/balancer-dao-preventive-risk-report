# Disclosure Channels & Payout Paths (Balancer)

## Official Bug Bounty (Smart Contracts Only)
- Immunefi: https://immunefi.com/bounty/balancer/
- Source doc: https://docs.balancer.fi/integration-guides/price-impact/price-impact.md (links to security page)
- Security doc (Balancer docs repo): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balancer/docs/5edf1870e5696e44b652f299929b5b131e1a9a89/docs/reference/contracts/security.md
  - Notes from the doc:
    - “Bounties only apply to protocol smart contracts.”
    - “Bug reports pertaining to Balancer’s web interfaces… are not eligible.”

## Security Contact (Out of Bug Bounty Scope)
- Email: **security@balancer.finance**
- Source: security doc above (Balancer docs repo)
- Recommended for UI/SDK or web interface findings.

## Forum Posting (Discussion / Governance)
- Forum categories (no dedicated security category):
  - Governance: https://forum.balancer.fi/c/governance/7
  - General Chat: https://forum.balancer.fi/c/general-chat/10
- Use forum post to request the preferred disclosure channel for UI/SDK risk reports.
