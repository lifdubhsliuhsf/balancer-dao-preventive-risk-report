# Security Contact Email Template (UI/SDK Precision Divergence)

Subject: Preventive report: UI–SDK numerical precision divergence (no exploit)

Hello Balancer Security Team,

I’m sharing a preventive report on UI/SDK numerical precision divergence (no exploit and no mainnet transactions). The report shows measurable precision loss when UI paths convert fixed‑point values to JS `Number`, which can affect price‑impact/validation thresholds as Balancer scales. This appears to be outside the Immunefi smart‑contract scope, so I’m reporting directly to this email.

Happy to answer questions or re‑submit in a preferred channel if one exists.

Thanks,
<your name>
